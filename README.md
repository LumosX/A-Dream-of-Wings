A "narrative-driven" RPG that has you try to escape a doomed world whilst interacting with its denizens, all set against a backdrop of an interstellar war that your nation is losing. Multiple endings.

This time around the theme of the competition was **starting with nothing**, and you pretty much do, starting with no money and no abilities. Check out the [ldjam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/a-dream-of-wings) page for screenshots.

Ranked 48th (out of hundreds) in the mood category, and moody it is indeed. I liked this one a lot, even though I had to improvise quite a bit regarding the audio, and though I wanted to make it bigger and better. Made for Ludum Dare 45.
